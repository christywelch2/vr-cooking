A multiplayer networked VR game for use with Google Cardboard viewers.

Users work as a team to complete a recipe that they have selected, throwing
ingredients from their pantries into the mixing bowl to fulfill each step of the recipe.

Using the Cardboard's pushbutton and reticle pointer, users select ingredients from
their pantries and toss them into the bowl. As ingredients are used, they are replenished
randomly in a card game-like style. At any given time, one player alone may not have the
necessary ingredients, thus relying on the team to help complete the recipe.
